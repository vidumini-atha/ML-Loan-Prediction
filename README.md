# Loan Approval Prediction System Using Machine Learning

## 📖 Overview
The Loan Approval Prediction System leverages powerful machine learning techniques to predict loan approval statuses using a Kaggle dataset. The project is designed to streamline the loan approval process by automating predictions with accuracy and reliability, making it a practical tool for financial institutions.

## 🛠 Features
#### •	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  Comprehensive analysis of data trends, patterns, and anomalies to guide preprocessing and model selection.
#### •	Data Visualization:
  Visual insights into data distributions and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
#### •	Data Preprocessing:
  Addressed missing values, encoded categorical variables, and managed class imbalance for a r	obust dataset.
#### •	Machine Learning Models:
  Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of 80.52%.
  Random Forest Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 74.68%.
#### •	Hyperparameter Tuning:
  Optimized model performance with GridSearchCV.
#### •	Evaluation Metrics:
  Compared models using accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure fair and reliable predictions.
